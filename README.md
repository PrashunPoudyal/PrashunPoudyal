# Prashun Poudyal

I am a 15 year old AP student at Dr. Anne Anderson High School and I want to work in Computer Science when I am older. I am Nepali and was raised in Edmonton, Canada. I am more STEM oriented and am very good at programming and mathematics. My favourite subjects in school are physics and computer science.

I am very good at Python and am comfortable programming virtually anything in that language, but I also have some experience in C++ and Java.
